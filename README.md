# LPP-python3
## This is a modified python3.11 version of LPP codes
## You can find the original repository for LPP codes (python2.7) at the following github site
## https://github.com/ParticulateFlow/LPP.git
#-------------------------------------------------------
# Further debugs ongoing

## 1) 2to3 and modernize tool generate lots of indentation issues
## 2) autopep8 tool to fix indentation issues
## 3) delete and reorganize some deprecated functions (exceptions, time.clock, etc) in lpp.py, pizza.py, dump.py and vtk.py
## 4) workflow needs to be optimized on windows/linux cross platforms (python functions not fully interchangable) 

# Main block (lpp.py, dump.py and vtk.py) is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.11 since Aug 13, 2024
