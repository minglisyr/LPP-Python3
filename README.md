# LPP-python3
## This is a modified python3.11 version of LPP codes
## You can find the original repository for LPP codes (python2.7.18) at the following github site
## https://github.com/ParticulateFlow/LPP.git
#-------------------------------------------------------
# Further debugs ongoing

## 1) 2to3 tool generate lots of indentation issues
## 2) autopep8 tool to fix indentation issues
## 3) delete and reorganize some deprecated functions (exceptions, time.clock, etc) in lpp.py, pizza.py and dump.py
## 4) workflow needs to be optimized on windows/linux cross platforms (python functions not fully interchangable)
